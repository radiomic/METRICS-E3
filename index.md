## Welcome to METRICS-E3

METRICS-E3 is the official Explanation and Elaboration document of the METhodological RadiomICs Score (METRICS). Developed by the EuSoMII Radiomics Auditing Group, METRICS-E3 is specifically crafted to help researchers deeply understand and evaluate the methodological quality of radiomics research. It provides detailed explanations, real-world positive examples from published literature, and illustrative negative examples, enhancing clarity and comprehension of each item and condition.

## What is METRICS?

METRICS is a structured tool developed to assess the quality of radiomics studies. Created through a transparent, expert-led consensus involving a diverse international panel, METRICS was officially endorsed by the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics (EuSoMII). It was designed as a robust quality evaluation instrument that guides methodological rigor in radiomics. METRICS has 30 items along with 5 conditions, covering both hand-crafted and deep learning-based radiomics, including computer vision.

## What to Expect from METRICS-E3?

METRICS-E3 is more than a supplementary document. It offers detailed explanations, elaborations, examples for each METRICS item and condition, and recommendations for appropriate and reproducible scoring. For every item or condition, you will find:  

- A concise rationale explaining why it matters,
- Positive examples drawn from published studies,
- Hypothetical negative examples for contrast,
- Guidance on how to score the item or select the condition appropriately.  

These resources collectively ensure METRICS is applied effectively and consistently.
