## Welcome to METRICS-E3

METRICS-E3 is the official Explanation and Elaboration companion to the METRICS checklist. Developed by the EuSoMII Radiomics Auditing Group, METRICS-E3 is specifically crafted to help researchers deeply understand and evaluate the methodological quality of radiomics research. It provides detailed explanations, real-world positive examples from published literature, and illustrative negative examples, enhancing clarity and comprehension of each checklist item.

## What is METRICS?

METRICS, short for METhodological RadiomICs Score, is a structured tool developed to assess the quality of radiomics studies. Created through a transparent, expert-led consensus involving a diverse international panel, METRICS was officially endorsed by the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics (EuSoMII). It was designed as a robust quality evaluation instrument that guides methodological rigor in radiomics.
